This is my personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration for my desktops and servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Why publishing?**
>
> 1. Making this repository public allows me to setup devices easier since I
>    don't need to manage credentials.
> 2. Public Nix configs allows new users to get inspired by different ideas
>    and configuration methods.
